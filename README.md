## ⚠️ Antivirus Notice

> Some antivirus programs may **mistakenly flag CredVault as malicious** when you try to install or launch it. This is a **false positive** commonly triggered by applications built using modern compilation tools like Nuitka or PyInstaller, especially if they are new and unsigned.

CredVault **does not contain malware**. It is 100% safe, offline, and private. We are working to register a digital signature for the installer to prevent these warnings in the future.

If your antivirus blocks or deletes the file:
- Temporarily allow the installer through your antivirus.
- Or download the portable version (if available) and run it without installation.

## 🔧 How It Works

CredVault is a fully offline desktop application. All sensitive data is encrypted and stored locally. There is no cloud backup, sync, or remote account — everything stays on your machine, under your control.

It supports multiple users, allowing each one to create their own encrypted vault, protected by a master password. Once launched, CredVault remains in your system tray for seamless access, and will automatically lock itself after inactivity or manual logout.

## 📦 Installation

CredVault is distributed as a standalone installer for Windows. You can download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/White-Demo/CredVault/releases/tag/v1.1.0) page. Once installed, you can create your user account and start storing passwords immediately — no registration or internet connection required.

## 📁 Data Ownership

You retain full ownership of your data. The vault is stored locally on your computer, and you can back it up, move it, or delete it at any time. Only you have the keys — we do not and cannot access your information.

## ❗ Important Notice

> Lost your master password? We cannot help recover it. CredVault is intentionally designed this way to maximize privacy and data protection.
