# 💎 CredVault – Local Password Manager

**CredVault** is a modern, offline-first password manager built with privacy, simplicity, and user control in mind. It is designed for users who want complete autonomy over their credentials, without relying on third-party cloud services or external syncing.

## 🛡️ Key Features

- 🔐 **Local Encryption** – All credentials and personal data are stored securely on your device, never transmitted to the internet.
- 👥 **Multi-user Support** – Each user has an isolated vault and personalized access.
- 🧠 **Master Password Access** – Only you know your master key. Without it, data is inaccessible — even to us.
- 🌙 **System Tray Integration** – Runs silently in the background with a tray icon for quick access and locking.
- 📊 **Security Dashboard** – Analyze password strength and detect reused or weak entries.
- ⭐ **Favorites & Folder Organization** – Keep your logins structured and easy to manage.
- 🛠️ **Integrated Password Generator** – Create complex, strong passwords instantly.
- 🔄 **Secure Auto-Logout** – Sessions are cleared automatically or on demand, for peace of mind.

## 🔧 How It Works

CredVault is a fully offline desktop application. All sensitive data is encrypted and stored locally. There is no cloud backup, sync, or remote account — everything stays on your machine, under your control.

It supports multiple users, allowing each one to create their own encrypted vault, protected by a master password. Once launched, CredVault remains in your system tray for seamless access, and will automatically lock itself after inactivity or manual logout.

## 📦 Installation

CredVault is distributed as a standalone installer for Windows. You can download the latest version from the [Releases](#) page. Once installed, you can create your user account and start storing passwords immediately — no registration or internet connection required.

## 📁 Data Ownership

You retain full ownership of your data. The vault is stored locally on your computer, and you can back it up, move it, or delete it at any time. Only you have the keys — we do not and cannot access your information.

## ❗ Important Notice

> Lost your master password? We cannot help recover it. CredVault is intentionally designed this way to maximize privacy and data protection.
